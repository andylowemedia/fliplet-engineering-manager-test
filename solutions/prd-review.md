# PRD Review
## Review
Issue 1: The PRD lacks clear acceptance criteria or success metrics, making it impossible to determine when the feature 
is “done” or meets business goals.
- Issue 2: No technical or functional requirements for authentication, authorisation, or security are included, leaving 
- user data protection undefined.
- Issue 3: Missing handling for edge cases and errors (e.g., invalid email format, duplicate accounts, server failures), 
- which risks poor user experience and data integrity issues.

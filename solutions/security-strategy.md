# Security Strategy: JWT Expiry Fix
## Problem
Currenyly Tokens never expire.
## Solution Access Flow tokens with expiry
### Goal: Access tokens have a sort life span, refresh tokens are long-lived but strictly controlled.
#### Flow Overview
##### Login / Authentication
1. User submits credentials (or OAuth flow, etc.).
2. Server validates credentials.
3. Server issues:
      - Access Token: short-lived (e.g., 5–15 minutes), contains user claims.
      - Refresh Token: long-lived (e.g., 30 days), stored securely server-side or in a revocable store.
##### Using Access Tokens
1. Client includes access token in Authorization: Bearer <token> headers for API calls.
2. API validates signature & expiry of the token.
##### Token Refresh
1. When access token expires, client uses refresh token to get a new access token.
2. Server validates the refresh token (check against DB or revocation list).
3. Server issues a new access token (and optionally a new refresh token for rotation).
##### Logout / Revocation
1. When user logs out or refresh token is suspected compromised:
2. Delete/mark refresh token as revoked in DB.
3. Access token naturally expires quickly.

## Gradual Rollout Strategy
We must avoid breaking existing users with permanent JWTs.
### Phase 0 – Detection & Segmentation
Identify users with old tokens.
Support dual validation: existing tokens valid until expiry OR forced refresh.
### Phase 1 – Short-lived Access Tokens
Start issuing short-lived access tokens alongside old ones.
Set refresh tokens for new sessions only.
Log usage of old tokens for monitoring.
### Phase 2 – Force Refresh
Require refresh token usage after old access token expires.
Users must re-authenticate if they don’t have a refresh token.
### Phase 3 – Revoke Legacy Tokens
Expire all legacy never-expiring tokens in the database.
Roll out only access + refresh token flow.
### Phase 4 – Enforcement & Monitoring
Monitor refresh attempts and token abuse.
Implement alerting for suspicious refresh activity.
### Notes:
Can implement grace period for existing tokens.
Use feature flags or versioned endpoints for smoother transition.

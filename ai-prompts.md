# AI Prompt Logging

## üìù AI Usage Summary
- **Did AI help you solve any problems? If so, how?**

  - For the VueJS task I used AI to work out the answer as I have no real experience with VueJS only ReactJS.
  - For the Terraform task I used AI to work out the answer as I have no real experience with Terraform. However, I did check through the steps I could recognise that would cover creating whats needed. I checked that there are load balancers, listeners, target groups, all the necessary security groups, task definitions, tasks, services and the ECS cluster itself.
  - For the AWS Debugging Secnario I had guessed areas where I would experiement with it in a test scenario. I did still put the whole task through Ai to confirm my answer and give more detail.
  - I worked out part of the Salability strategy scenario, in the sense of using S3, lambdas, and step functions to complete the work. However I did still put the whole task in AI to confirm my thinking and used it complete the wording.
  - I only used AI for the correct wording and steps for the JWT expiry fix task, as i had been working on my own Oauth server so knew the flows.

- **What parts were 100% human-driven?**
  - For tasks Typescript Performance and Express JS tasks, no AI were used for them
  - I didn't use any AI for the PRD, as that seemed very clear to me.
  - In the JWT expiry fix task, I ad planned out everything myself on what would happen.
  - 
- **Did AI generate incorrect/misleading answers? How did you correct them?**
  - Everything seemed to be correct in what it generated in terms of coding.
- **Which AI-powered IDE tools did you use? (e.g., GitHub Copilot, Cursor, ChatGPT in VS Code, etc.)**
  - I used the web based version of ChatGPT, It seemed to give me the answers I would expect and it didn't appear to show any errors.
